This is a sparse dictionary classifier implemented
with python and numpy using compressive sensing
methods. It uses orthogonal matching pursuit to
get a sparse approximation of which subset of 
class representative vectors best represent an 
unseen incoming vector.

I wrote this basically just for fun towards the
end of a linear algebra class which talked quite
a bit about compressed sensing. Although I doubt 
this type of classifier will become an industry
standard it is very different from all other 
classification methods I have seen and, unlike
some others, I feel I truly understand it.
